        android:text="The Porsche Cayenne is a series of high performance mid-size luxury crossovers manufactured by the German company Porsche since 2002. The first generation was known internally within Porsche as the Type 9PA (955/957) or E1. It is the first V8-engined vehicle built by Porsche since 1995, when the Porsche 928 was discontinued. It is also Porsche's first off-road variant vehicle since its Super and Junior tractors of the 1950s, and the first Porsche with four doors. Since 2014, the Cayenne has been sold alongside a smaller Porsche SUV, the Macan. The second-generation Cayenne (Type 92A or E2) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March. The Cayenne shares its platform, body frame, doors and electronics with the similar Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7. It received a facelift in 2014 with minor external changes, and introduced a new plug-in E-Hybrid version, with its public launch at the Paris Motor Show.[3] Since 2008, all engines have featured direct injection technology. The third generation (Type PO536) was unveiled in 2017 at Stuttgart. The S in the 955 is powered by a 4.5L V8 engine with a dry-sump lubrication system and variable valve timing. It produces 335 hp (250 kW; 340 PS) and 310 lb⋅ft (420 N⋅m) of torque. Acceleration from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) takes 6.9 seconds and the top speed is 150 mph (241 km/h).[8] Introduced only for 2006 (as a pre-GTS concept), the Cayenne S Titanium Edition was a one-year exclusive, limited production SUV featuring a lightweight steel body, featuring an aluminium hood (lighter than the one equipped on the Cayenne S), titanium-painted accented body parts, side lower rocker body panels, Sport-Quad Tip Exhaust chrome tailpipes, 19&quot; titanium painted alloy wheels, bi-xenon headlights, two-tone interior upholstery, Porsche PCM 2.0 w/ trip computer navigation, MP3 audio and Bose cabin surround sound. Under the hood, improvements included sport-tuned suspension, an aerodynamic body package, low-range transfer case, locking differential and a 6-speed automatic Tiptronic transmission. The Cayenne S Titanium Edition is powered by the same 4.5L V8 engine that powered the Cayenne S - still producing 335 hp (250 kW; 340 PS) and 310 lb⋅ft (420 N⋅m) of torque. Acceleration is even quicker than the regular Cayenne S from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) at sub 6.2 seconds[] and the top speed is 150 mph (241 km/h).  "
