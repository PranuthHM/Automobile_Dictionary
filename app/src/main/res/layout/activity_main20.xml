        android:text="The Tata Tiago is a 5-door hatchback city car made by Tata Motors in India since 2016. Codenamed the &quot;Kite&quot; during development, the Tiago was previously announced as the Tata Zica, with &quot;Zica&quot; short for &quot;zippy car&quot;, but it was changed because the launch of the car coincided with the outbreak of Zika virus. Tiago, a common Portuguese masculine name, was simultaneously picked from suggestions solicited online and from brand naming company Appella's fully validated shortlist of names, who were commissioned by Tata Motors to find an alternative name in February 2016.  Since March 2017, a sedan derivative of the Tiago known as the Tigor has been produced. The Tata Tiago was created as the successor of the previous Tata Bolt, which was not met with much success. Tata began designing a completely new vehicle (Kite project) of a city car with 5-door body that could boost the sales of the brand in the Indian automotive market. The car was based on the Tata X0 platform that also underpinned the Indica and the Bolt, however the platform was modified and shortened in order to lower production costs. Tata also used the in-house Revotron and Revotorq three-cylinder engines, replacing the Fiat FIRE and Multijet engines used in previous models. The Tiago is being produced only in right-hand drive at the Tata Motors Sanand Plant in India. The Tiago is powered by a 1.2-litre Revotron three-cylinder 12V petrol that produces 83 BHP (62 kW) power and 114 N⋅m (84 lb⋅ft; 12 kg⋅m) of maximum torque combined with a 5-speed manual transmission or 5-speed AMT, or a 1.1-litre Revotorq three-cylinder diesel engine producing 69 BHP (51 kW) of power and 140 N⋅m (103 lb⋅ft; 14 kg⋅m) of maximum torque, combined with a 5-speed manual transmission.   In September 2018, Tata Motors launched the Tiago NRG, a crossover like trim with the ground clearance increased by 10 mm (0.4 in)."
